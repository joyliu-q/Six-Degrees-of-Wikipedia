# Six-Degrees-of-Wikipedia
Six degrees of Kevin Bacon, but for Wikipedia. 

This is a webscraping project inspired by the six degrees of Kevin Bacon (also known as the six degrees of separation),  where "all people are six, or fewer, social connections away from each other" (Wikipedia). This project determines the whether this rule also falls true with Wikipedia pages and their redirect links, finding the shortest path between two pages given their url input. 

## Installation

Not available as of now. 

## Known Issues
